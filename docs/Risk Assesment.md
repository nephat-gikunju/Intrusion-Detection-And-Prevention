**Complexity of ML Integration:** 

Integrating machine learning into the IDPS can be challenging due to the need for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model tuning. This complexity may lead to delays in development and implementation. To mitigate this risk, it’s essential to research and use established frameworks and libraries, such as TensorFlow or scikit-learn, to simplify the integration process and leverage community support.

**False Positives in Anomaly Detection:**

 High rates of false positives can result in alert fatigue, decreasing trust in the system and potentially leading to critical threats being overlooked. To address this, implementing a feedback loop is crucial. This involves continuously refining detection algorithms and incorporating user feedback to reduce false positives over time.

**User Resistance:** 

Users may resist adopting the new IDPS due to unfamiliarity or fear of change, which can hinder the system's effectiveness. To combat this, it’s important to provide comprehensive training sessions and create clear, accessible documentation to foster understanding and confidence in using the system.

**Insufficient Training:** 

Without adequate training on the new system, users may struggle to use it effectively, leading to underutilization and potential security gaps. Developing thorough training materials, including tutorials, guides, and hands-on sessions, will ensure users are well-prepared to use the IDPS effectively.
